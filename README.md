# CodeClause_Market_Basket_Analysis
This repository provides an implementation of Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm in Python. Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used to identify patterns or associations among items frequently purchased together in a transactional dataset.By analyzing these patterns, businesses can gain valuable insights to improve product placement, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance customer experiences.

Key Features:

Implementation of the Apriori algorithm in Python for Market Basket Analysis.
Efficient handling of large transactional datasets.
Utilization of mlxtend to improve the compuattional performance (also has a great community support).
Visualization of frequent itemsets and association rules using matplotlib and networkx libraries.
Example dataset and Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of the implementation.
